<!--
  Hero details was a part of the AppComponent but we turned it into its own component
    and now reference it through the <hero-detail> directive

      Hero is a property in hero-detail.component.ts
      selectedHero is a property in app.component.ts

      We want them both to match
-->
<h2>My Heroes</h2>
<div>
  <label>Hero name:</label> <input #heroName />

    Add
  </button>

  <!-- *ngFor is a specific type of directive called a structural derective, also *ngIf -->
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes" 
  [class.selected]="hero === selectedHero" (click)="onSelect(hero)">
    <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span>
